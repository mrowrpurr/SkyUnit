scriptName SkyUnit2TestSuite extends Quest hidden
{Represents a suite of SkyUnit tests

Each test suite stores all of the SkyUnitTest scripts
associated with it and all of the results of test runs.

To add tests to a test suite, simply define a SkyUnitTest
and it will be automatically added to the default test suite.

Usually you will not need to configure multiple test suites
yourself, this is done by the SkyUnit test runner tools for you.

See `SkyUnitTest` for more information.
